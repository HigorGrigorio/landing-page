                what are tables?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Tables are two-dimensional lists of data and are made up of rows and columns. Therefore, they are widely
                used to present data in an organized way. A great example of how important tables are is the growing use
                of the Excel program, a mandatory selection requirement for many companies.

            <p>
                But what about presenting a table on your website, how does it work? For this, there is the possibility
                of creating tables through HTML itself, quickly and simply, through an HTML table.
                See below an example table.
